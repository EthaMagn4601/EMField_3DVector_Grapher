# EMField_3DVector_Grapher
How to use:
- Input your vector field equation that you would like to plot into the corresponding component entry fields.
- To switch between cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical vector field plotters, click on the upper left-hand corner of the application to file and select your desired field plotter. 

Warnings:
- Recommended gridsize [x*y*z]: x < 6, y < 6, z < 6 (max should be 10x10x10, due to matplotlib being very laggy)
- Don't input random variables into the text entry field areas (i.e. f, g, etc.)
